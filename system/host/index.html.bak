host : the host is the alter that most commonly uses the body . host alters
collectively fall under the category of fronters , or alters who frequently
“ front ” by taking control of the body and the front , conscious part of
the mind . host alters are responsible for most aspects of daily life , though
teams of fronter alters might divide up daily life into more manageable
and specialized units such as socialization , academia , work , and taking care
of the body . if the host has spent years unaware of the existence of other
alters and the trauma that created them , the host might have an extremely hard
time coming to accept their DID . this alter might be used to viewing themselves
as the only entity in their body and will likely at least at first view
themselves as the core . this may or may not be correct . according to the
theory of structural dissociation , all hosts are apparently normal parts .

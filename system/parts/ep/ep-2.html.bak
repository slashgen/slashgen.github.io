<p>
for those with secondary structural dissociation , there are multiple EP
that hold different traumatic materials and are  more developed than are
the EP present in primary structural dissociation . though those with C-PTSD
experience their EP in a very similar way to those with PTSD , EP are
more related to attachment for those with BPD . EP in those with other
specified dissociative disorder subtype 1 may present as any of the above
described EP or may mimic the fully developed and differentiated EP of
dissociative identity disorder .  EP may be triggered out by otherwise
benign stimuli that gradually became associated with trauma or abuse .
because of these less directly traumatic associations , some EP in secondary
structural dissociation may handle some daily life functions such as
exploration or play . many of these EP present or perceive themselves as
children and do not actually handle daily life well .
</p>
<p>
for those with tertiary structural dissociation , there are multiple EP
that are very similar to the EP present in secondary structural dissociation ,
particularly OSDD-1 . these EP are often more developed and differentiated ,
though not always , and they may perceive themselves as older instead of being
necessarily frozen in time .

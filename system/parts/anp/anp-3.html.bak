<p>
for those with secondary structural dissociation , the ANP may represent less
of the entire personality or be less similar to the pre-trauma personality
than it is in primary structural dissociation . for those with borderline
personality disorder (BPD) , the ANP might contain comparatively little due to
avoidance of the numerous EP and so struggle with feelings of chronic
emptiness , loneliness , and boredom and with identity confusion and a need
for others to help them know who to be . for those with other specified
dissociative disorder (OSDD-1) , the more developed EP may mean that less
is available for or more must be avoided by the ANP .  in contrast , those
with complex-posttraumatic stress disorder experience their ANP and EP in a
very similar manner to those with PTSD . the ANP of individuals with secondary
structural dissociation tend to have more maladaptive coping mechanisms than
do those with primary structural dissociation .

<p>
for those with tertiary structural dissociation , there are multiple ANP
that each handle different aspects of daily life . for example , one ANP
might be the host and handle school , relationships , and work . another
ANP might be better at relationships and so assist the first in that regard
either knowingly or unknowingly ( some believe that ANP always lose time
when they switch with each other and are not aware that they are not
each other ; for some with DID , this may be true ) while another might
help with a specific subject matter in school or aspect of work . another
ANP might handle the systems family of origin or help to take care of
dependent children . individuals with DID do not have a single ANP that
accurately reflects who they would be as a fully integrated personality .

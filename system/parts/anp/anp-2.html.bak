<p>
particularly desperate ANP might engage in self harm or use psychogenic
substances in attempts to forcefully tether themselves to the present and
prevent EP from intruding . it is likely that emotionally disconnected ANP
will struggle to form meaningful relationships with others and will have
a poor grasp of their own physical and emotional needs . however , the ANP
has a need to appear high functioning and may find it easier to avoid all
potentially triggering situations and actions , including those relating
to attaching to and trusting others , and throw themselves into work or
other non-reflective activities .
</p>
<p>
for those with primary structural dissociation , the ANP is the main part
of the personality and more closely represents the personality that existed
before the trauma or stress triggered structural dissociation of the
personality . the ANP is not exactly the individual who existed before
because the presence of the above disorders by necessity involves a change
of some sort in the individual experiencing them . when posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) is the result , the ANP will experience negative alterations
in cognition and mood that may vary in severity according to the individuals
general resilience and the amount and nature of the trauma experienced . as
well , the ANP may suffer from the complications explained above .

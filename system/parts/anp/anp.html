<h2 id="omg">apparently normal parts</h2>
<p>
apparently normal parts are the rational , present-oriented , and
grounded parts of the individual that handle daily life or , in the case
of dissociative identity disorder and so multiple ANP , aspects of
daily life . the jobs of the ANP include social interaction and attachment ,
taking care of others , work , play , exploration , learning , and taking
care of physical needs .
</p>
<p>
because ANP cannot properly integrate the traumatic materials contained by
the EP , they are often highly phobic of and avoidant towards reminders
of their trauma or further stress that could activate EP and so activate
traumatic or symptomatic intrusions. these avoidant behaviors can involve
amnesia , anesthesia ( insensitivity towards or loss of certain sensory
input ) , or limiting the ANPs range of emotions or numbing their emotional
intensity . these avoidant behaviors can drain mental energy and allow
for depression , anxiety , or chronic feelings of hopelessness , shame ,
guilt , or rage .

persecutors are alters that purposefully harm the body , system , host ,
core , or other alters , sabotage the systems goals or healing , or work
to assist the systems abusers . persecutors might hold self hatred or
provide an outlet for internalized abusive and negative messages . they
might believe that hurting the system or other alters is the only way to
control them or teach them how to behave and so prevent further and more
extreme abuse from outside abusers . they might be reenacting abuse or
trying to ensure that future abuse isnt more harmful due to being preceded
by a period of relatively little abuse . some persecutor alters are
introjects of abusers and may or may not understand that they are not
actually the abuser themselves .

<p>
an alter is a dissociated self state that may be associated with either dissociative identity
disorder ( DID ) or other specified dissociative disorder subtype 1 ( OSDD-1 ) . in cases of
DID , most if not all alters can take recurrent executive control of the body in which they
reside . alters each have their own perception of self as a unique individual or entity and
do not view themselves as only an aspect of a complete person . externally , alters can display
different degrees of emotional expressiveness , behave in different ways , and have different
skills and abilities related to sensory-motor functioning . they have different thoughts ,
perceptions , and memories relating to themselves and to the world around them . they may
perceive themselves as having an age , gender , sexuality , appearance , source , or even species
that may or may not match that of the systems actual body , and they may or may not be aware
of these discrepancies . ( some alters may see what they expect to see when they look into
mirrors and are highly distressed to realize that the body that they are in does not match
their internal perception of how they should look . ) often , alters have their own wants ,
needs , desires , and opinions . they may have psychological disorders and physiological
reactions that are unique to them or experience the bodys psychological and physiological disorders
in different ways or to different degrees than do other alters in the same body .

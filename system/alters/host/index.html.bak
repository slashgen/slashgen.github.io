<h2>host :</h2>
<p>
the host is the alter that most commonly uses the body . host alters
collectively fall under the category of fronters , or alters who frequently
“ front ” by taking control of the body and the front , conscious part of
the mind . host alters are responsible for most aspects of daily life , though
teams of fronter alters might divide up daily life into more manageable
and specialized units such as socialization , academia , work , and taking care
of the body . if the host has spent years unaware of the existence of other
alters and the trauma that created them , the host might have an extremely hard
time coming to accept their DID . this alter might be used to viewing themselves
as the only entity in their body and will likely at least at first view
themselves as the core . this may or may not be correct . according to the
theory of structural dissociation , all hosts are apparently normal parts .
</p>
<h2>memory holder :</h2>
<p>
memory holders are alters that hold memories that are usually traumatic in
nature so that other alters do not have to be confronted by the memories .
in some cases , memory holders might hold memories of childhood innocence
or of being loved by the systems otherwise abusive or neglectful family .
in these latter cases , the memory holder might serve to preserve
these memories untainted by memories of trauma or to avoid confronting
the system with the pain of what the abuse has cost them . memory holders
are highly associated with abuse takers , alters that experience trauma so
that other alters do not have to . memories holders are the prototypical
<a href="../parts/index.html">emotional part</a> in structural dissociation .
